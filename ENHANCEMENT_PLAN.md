# Implementation Plan: Replicating Camille Mormal Portfolio

This document outlines the plan to enhance our portfolio project to match the key features and user experience of the [Camille Mormal Recreation](https://camillemormal-recreation.vercel.app/works/full-sound) reference.

## Feature Comparison

| Component | Reference Implementation (`camillemormal-recreation`) | Your Implementation (`databayt`) | Analysis & Key Differences |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Progress Bar** | ‚Ä¢ A vertical bar on the left.<br>‚Ä¢ A small thumbnail of the current image follows the scroll position.<br>‚Ä¢ The thumbnail is only visible when hovering over the progress track.<br>‚Ä¢ Provides a visual "scrubber" to navigate the page vertically. | ‚Ä¢ A vertical bar on the left.<br>‚Ä¢ No scroll-linked thumbnail is present.<br>‚Ä¢ The bar itself fills based on scroll progress.<br>‚Ä¢ The interaction is purely visual feedback, not a navigation tool. | The biggest missing feature in your version is the **interactive scroll thumbnail**. The reference uses it to give users a preview of where they are scrolling to, making navigation more intuitive on a long page of images. |
| **Works Display** | ‚Ä¢ On the main gallery page, works are presented in a full-screen vertical slider.<br>‚Ä¢ Users navigate between projects using scroll or arrow keys.<br>‚Ä¢ The project title is large and centered.<br>‚Ä¢ The background image transitions smoothly. | ‚Ä¢ Your main gallery (`/gallery`) uses a similar full-screen vertical slider driven by scroll events (`works.tsx`).<br>‚Ä¢ The core mechanic is very similar, using Framer Motion for transitions.<br>‚Ä¢ You have a thumbnail strip at the bottom for direct navigation, which is a good UX addition. | Your core `works.tsx` component is functionally very close to the reference's main gallery page. The primary difference is one of polish and micro-interactions (e.g., the exact easing of animations, text effects on hover). |
| **Next Project Link**| ‚Ä¢ At the bottom of a project page, there is a large, full-width link to the next project.<br>‚Ä¢ Hovering over this link reveals the hero image of the next project as the background.<br>‚Ä¢ The text and a progress indicator (e.g., "02/08") are prominently displayed. | ‚Ä¢ Your `WorksLink` component exists but lacks the **image-reveal-on-hover** functionality.<br>‚Ä¢ It serves as a simple link to the next project without the rich visual preview that the reference has.<br>‚Ä¢ The styling is more basic, missing the large, immersive feel. | This is a significant difference in terms of user experience. The reference's "Works Link" acts as a powerful, engaging transition between projects, encouraging users to continue exploring. Yours is purely functional. |

## Action Plan

The following steps will be taken to implement the missing features using our current tech stack (Next.js, Framer Motion, GSAP).

### 1. **Enhance `ProgressBar` Component**
    - **State Management:** Add state to track hover status and thumbnail visibility.
    - **Scroll-Linked Thumbnail:** Create a new `ProgressThumbnail` component.
    - **Positioning Logic:** Use scroll progress to calculate the vertical position of the thumbnail.
    - **Styling:** Style the thumbnail to match the reference and add hover effects.

### 2. **Upgrade `WorksLink` Component**
    - **Data Fetching:** Modify the component to get data for the *next* project in the list, including its hero image.
    - **Hover State:** Implement `onHoverStart` and `onHoverEnd` to toggle a state.
    - **Background Image Reveal:** Create a container with `overflow: hidden` and animate the hero image of the next project into view on hover.
    - **Styling:** Update the component's styling to be full-width and match the reference's typography and layout.

### 3. **Refine Animations and Micro-interactions**
    - **Review Easing:** Analyze and adjust `cubic-bezier` values and durations in Framer Motion transitions to match the reference's fluidity.
    - **Text Effects:** Add subtle text animations (e.g., on hover) to improve visual feedback.

This plan will be executed sequentially to ensure each new feature is built correctly upon the existing architecture.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### 1. **Enhance `ProgressBar` Component - COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Created `ProgressThumbnail` component for hover preview
- ‚úÖ Updated `ProgressBar` with hover state management  
- ‚úÖ Added scroll-linked positioning logic
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Data structure transformation (nested arrays ‚Üí flat WorkImage objects)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: CSS conflicts (removed old progress bar styles)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Proper z-index and positioning

### 2. **Upgrade `WorksLink` Component - COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Removed old scroll-based animations
- ‚úÖ Added hover-to-reveal image effect
- ‚úÖ Updated styling to match reference design
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Data structure compatibility (next ‚Üí nextProject)

### 3. **Refine Animations and Micro-interactions - COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Updated `SliderAnim.layer` with faster duration (0.8s) and new easing
- ‚úÖ Added subtle scale and opacity transitions
- ‚úÖ Simplified text animations (removed clipPath, added clean slide)

## üêõ Issues Resolved

**Progress Bar Not Rendering:**
- Root cause: Data structure mismatch (nested arrays vs WorkImage objects)
- Fix: Added data transformation in `[slug]/page.tsx`
- Additional: Removed conflicting old CSS rules

**Scrolling Getting Stuck:**
- Root cause: CSS conflicts between old and new progress bar styles
- Fix: Removed old `.progress-bar` CSS rules that were overriding new implementation
- Additional: Improved `useScroll` offset configuration

## üöÄ Final Result - Reference-Level Implementation

The portfolio now closely mirrors the [Camille Mormal reference repository](https://github.com/ValeraViachalo/camillemormal-recreation) with:

### **Enhanced Progress Bar** ‚ú®
- ‚úÖ Locomotive-scroll-inspired smoothness with spring animations
- ‚úÖ Click-to-navigate functionality (click anywhere on progress bar to jump)
- ‚úÖ Improved hover states with track/fill visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Better scroll tracking with refined spring physics
- ‚úÖ Hover thumbnails with smooth positioning

### **Reference-Quality Works Navigation** üéØ
- ‚úÖ Auto-navigation when scrolled to bottom (like reference)
- ‚úÖ Scroll indicator with animated arrow
- ‚úÖ Progress bar that fills when auto-navigation triggers
- ‚úÖ Enhanced hover image reveal with improved scaling
- ‚úÖ Page transition effects with overflow control
- ‚úÖ Better timing and delays matching reference feel

- ‚úÖ Enhanced layer transitions with opacity and scale effects
- ‚úÖ Staggered animations for better visual hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Improved enter/exit timing (1.1s enter, 0.8s exit)
