## Business Model

Databayt operates through four complementary revenue models that support both sustainability and community-driven growth.

<div className="space-y-6 my-8">
  <div className="py-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">Per Project</h3>
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Bespoke Development for Unique Business Needs</h4>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      We deliver custom-built automation systems tailored to the specific operational requirements of individual clients.
    </div>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground list-disc pl-4">
      <li>Ideal for companies with complex or specialized workflows</li>
      <li>Involves discovery, architecture, design, and implementation phases</li>
      <li>Generates revenue through direct service contracts</li>
      <li>Often integrates components from our codebase to reduce time-to-delivery</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div className="py-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">Partners</h3>
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Strategic Collaborations & Outsourced Development</h4>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      We form long-term partnerships with businesses that need recurring access to development capacity and domain-specific technical talent.
    </div>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground list-disc pl-4">
      <li>Perfect for agencies, enterprises, or startups without an in-house tech team</li>
      <li>Offers flexible engagement models: staff augmentation, dedicated teams, or project-based collaborations</li>
      <li>Revenue comes from retainers, joint ventures, or shared-value agreements</li>
      <li>Partners also benefit from priority access to our open-source tools and components</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div className="py-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">Codebase</h3>
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Reusable Components as a Revenue Engine</h4>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      The Databayt codebase is the backbone of our operation: a growing library of clean, modular components contributed by the community.
    </div>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground list-disc pl-4">
      <li>These components are used across client projects and SaaS products</li>
      <li>Contributors earn recognition and a share of the value their code generates</li>
      <li>Monetization occurs when projects leverage these prebuilt modules to accelerate delivery</li>
      <li>Encourages collective ownership and open-source sustainability</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div className="py-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">SaaS</h3>
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Scalable Automation Products for Common Needs</h4>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      We package recurring patterns into ready-to-deploy SaaS tools aimed at industries with similar operational challenges.
    </div>
    <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground list-disc pl-4">
      <li>Examples: CRMs for clinics, document workflow tools for HR, or compliance dashboards for real estate</li>
      <li>Allows clients to onboard instantly with minimal configuration</li>
      <li>SaaS offerings are continuously improved through usage data and community feedback</li>
