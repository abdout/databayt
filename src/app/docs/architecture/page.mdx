## Architecture

Our architecture is engineered from the ground up for reusability, modularity, and a world-class developer experience. It's not just a system for building applications; it's a framework for composing "atomic" automation components into a powerful, collaborative, and AI-augmented ecosystem. We prioritize a scalable, feature-based structure to ensure that every contribution adds lasting, discoverable value to the entire codebase.

### Core Architectural Principles

Our design decisions are guided by a few key principles:

- **Component-Driven Modularity** – Inspired by the philosophy of shadcn/ui, we provide a codebase of reusable, customizable components at their most minimal, essential state. Every piece of functionality is an "atomic" building block designed for composition.
- **Superior Developer Experience** – We believe that an intuitive and predictable structure is key to productivity. Our architecture is designed to be easily understood, navigated, and extended.
- **Feature-Based & Composable** – The system is built as a collection of features, enabling a micro-services and micro-frontends approach. Independent components and services can be developed, deployed, and composed to build complex applications.
- **Serverless-First** – We leverage a serverless paradigm to eliminate infrastructure management, enable automatic scaling, and optimize operational costs. Our system scales seamlessly from a single user to enterprise-level demand.
- **Type-Safety by Default** – We enforce strict type safety across the entire stack, from the database to the frontend. This minimizes runtime errors and enhances code reliability.
- **AI-Augmented Workflow** – Artificial intelligence is woven into the fabric of our architecture. From AI-assisted coding to intelligent automation agents, we use AI to accelerate the development lifecycle.

### The Composition Hierarchy: From Atoms to Apps

Our methodology is based on a clear and scalable composition hierarchy. We don't just provide code; we provide the building blocks for value creation.

1. **Atoms** – The foundation is built using core shadcn/ui components and other primitives. These are the most basic, indivisible UI elements.
2. **Templates** – We shape Atoms into Templates—reusable layouts and component compositions that solve common UI patterns (e.g., a standard page layout, a data table structure).
3. **Building Blocks** – A Building Block combines Templates with client-side logic (`hooks.ts`, `validation.ts`) to create interactive, feature-rich user experiences.
4. **Microservices** – A Microservice is the combination of Building Blocks with backend logic (`actions.ts`). It's a fully encapsulated feature, complete with its UI, data models, and API, that can operate independently.
5. **Full Apps** – Finally, we craft Full Apps by composing various Microservices, creating a cohesive, enterprise-grade solution.

This layered approach, influenced by component management platforms like Bit, ensures that every part of the system is reusable and contributes to a greater whole.

### Project Structure: A Feature-Based, Mirror-Pattern Approach

Our project structure follows a predictable, mirror-pattern architecture that enhances code discoverability and creates an intuitive mental model for developers.

#### Philosophy: URL-to-Directory Mapping

Every URL route has a corresponding, mirrored directory structure for its component logic. If you can see a URL, you know exactly where to find its code.

```text
URL: /appointment
```

mirrors to:

```text
app/appointment/          (Next.js App Router files)
components/appointment/   (All related component logic)
```

#### Directory Structure

```text
project-root/
├── app/                     # Next.js App Router (Routing & Layouts)
│   ├── appointment/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   └── loading.tsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── page.tsx
│       └── settings/
│           └── page.tsx
│
├── components/              # Component Logic (Mirrors `app` structure)
│   ├── appointment/
│   │   ├── actions.ts       # Server actions & API calls
│   │   ├── constants.ts     # Arrays, enums, static data
│   │   ├── validation.ts    # Zod schemas & validation logic
│   │   ├── types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces & types
│   │   ├── form.tsx         # Form components
│   │   ├── cards.tsx        # Card components
│   │   ├── content.tsx      # UI content components
│   │   └── hooks.ts         # Custom React hooks
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── actions.ts
│       ├── constants.ts
│       └── settings/
│           ├── form.tsx
│           └── validation.ts
│
├── lib/                     # Shared utilities & functions
├── types/                   # Global TypeScript definitions
└── public/                  # Static assets
```

### Standardized File Patterns

To ensure consistency, each feature directory follows standardized naming conventions. A CLI tool helps scaffold these files automatically, enforcing the pattern across the codebase.

| File           | Purpose                                   | Example Content                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `actions.ts`   | Server actions, API calls, data mutations | `createAppointment()`, `updateStatus()` |
| `constants.ts` | Static data, enums, configuration         | Status arrays, default values           |
| `validation.ts`| Zod schemas for form and API validation   | Input schemas, error messages           |
| `types.ts`     | TypeScript interfaces and type definitions| Component props, data models            |
| `form.tsx`     | Form components using React Hook Form     | Input fields, submission logic, state   |
| `cards.tsx`    | Card-based UI components                  | Data display cards, interactive elements|
| `content.tsx`  | General UI content and layout components  | Headers, descriptions, sections         |
| `hooks.ts`     | Custom React hooks for state and effects  | `useAppointmentState()`, `useStatusQuery()` |

We leverage **TypeScript Generics** extensively within these files, especially in `types.ts` and `hooks.ts`, to create highly reusable and flexible logic that can be adapted to various data structures without sacrificing type safety.

### System Layers & Data Flow

This structured, component-based approach integrates seamlessly with our technical system layers.

1. **Presentation Layer (Next.js/React)** – Renders the components defined in `form.tsx`, `cards.tsx`, and `content.tsx`.
2. **Application & API Layer (Vercel)** – Executes the logic from `actions.ts`, validates data with schemas from `validation.ts`, and handles authentication with Auth.js.
3. **Data & Persistence Layer (PlanetScale/Prisma)** – Interacts with the database based on the schemas and types defined in `types.ts`.
4. **AI & Automation Core (Python/Rust/LangGraph)** – The complex automation agents are often invoked from within `actions.ts`, acting as the most powerful type of "microservice."
5. **Development & Integration Layer** – Our CLI, Cursor editor, and Claude assistant all understand this structure, making development a fluid, AI-augmented experience we call Vibe Coding.

#### A Typical Interaction

1. A user interacts with a component from `form.tsx` on the Next.js frontend, triggering a Server Action from `actions.ts`.  
2. The request payload is validated by a Zod schema from `validation.ts`.  
3. The serverless function uses the type-safe Prisma client to query PlanetScale, using interfaces from `types.ts`.  
4. For complex tasks, the action invokes a LangGraph agent.  
5. The result is **streamed** back and managed by a hook from `hooks.ts`, efficiently updating the UI.
