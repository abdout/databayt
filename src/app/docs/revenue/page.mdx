# Revenue Sharing

**No traditional salaries here.** Databayt is collectively owned by us - the contributors. When our sales team brings in projects, we complete them together and everyone takes their share, including sales. You're not an employee; you're a co-owner building equity in something bigger.

We use a transparent revenue-sharing model where contributors earn a percentage of revenue generated from their contributions across our four core business models:

## Our Business Models & Your Revenue Opportunities

### Per Project Revenue
Custom solutions tailored to specific client requirements and business processes. Each project delivers unique automation systems designed to solve particular challenges and operational needs.

**Your Earnings:** Direct revenue share based on your contribution to project completion. Whether you build components, integrate systems, or manage client requirements - you earn from the project's success.

### Partnership Revenue 
Partnership opportunities for businesses seeking to outsource technology development, access specialized talent for temporary projects, and leverage specific technical expertise.

**Your Earnings:** Revenue share from partnership contracts you help fulfill. Long-term partnerships create recurring income streams as you become the go-to expert for specific partner needs.

### Codebase Revenue *(Our Highest Earner)*
Our codebase executes the majority of tasks through accumulated, reusable components. Contributors who expand this foundation earn a share of the value it generates across all projects that use their components.

**Your Earnings:** This is where the 40-70% project acceleration pays off. Every time your indexed components are reused in client projects, you earn. Build once, earn repeatedly. Top codebase contributors earn $2,000-5,000+ monthly from component reuse alone.

### SaaS Revenue
Ready-to-deploy software products sold to multiple organizations with similar needs. We act as a go-to central hub for businesses seeking automation solutions.

**Your Earnings:** Ongoing royalties from SaaS products you help build. As these products scale to hundreds or thousands of customers, your revenue share grows proportionally.

## Why This Model Works

When the sales department brings in a $50,000 project:
- Sales team gets their share
- Project contributors get their share  
- Codebase contributors whose components are used get their share
- Everyone wins when we succeed together

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Month 1-3:** Learn systems, contribute to projects, earn $200-800
- **Month 6-12:** Build reusable components, participate in partnerships, earn $800-2,500  
- **Year 2+:** Major codebase contributor with SaaS involvement, earn $2,500-8,000+

The more value you create for our collective ecosystem, the more you earn. It's that simple.
