## Introduction

**Automate** the boring. at Databayt we're building codebase for business automation, one atomic component at a time. Every line of code is open source, every contribution is valued, and every developer may shape the future of how businesses operate.

We sell the origin of all value — we sell **Time**, the currency that drives the world — what if you could reclaim yours and focus on what truly matters?
It's more than a service — it's an escape from the matrix.
A restoration of time through the elimination of repetitive tasks, streamlined operations, and automated processes.
Break free. Reclaim your hours.

The Repository of **Wonders.** Think of our codebase as a living library where every contribution becomes part of something greater. From atomic components to complete templates, from blocks to micro-services to full automation solutions—we're creating the building blocks that will power tomorrow's businesses.

Follow along as we **figure** this out together. This isn't just about building software; it's about creating a collaborative ecosystem where developers, businesses, and innovators unite to solve real problems. Every contribution you make doesn't just help one project—it becomes part of a growing foundation that serves countless businesses worldwide.
