So you've heard about Databayt and you're curious. Maybe someone invited you to contribute, or you stumbled across our project and want to understand what we're all about. Either way, **welcome!**

This page is specifically for you - the newcomer who has questions, concerns, and wants to understand how this all works before diving in.

## Why Databayt

Databayt is a collaborative open-source ecosystem designed to accelerate development. With a patterned, searchable code library, developers can start projects up to 70% complete—never from scratch. While open source has come a long way and countless codebases already exist, there's still real value in building a well-structured, indexed library where code follows consistent patterns and architecture. Databayt is about creating that shared standard—together. It's not just practical; it's exciting to shape a clean, reusable codebase as a community—making development faster for everyone, and driving collective progress for Databayt as a publicly traded entity.

## Remote Work

**Yes, 100% remote.** There's no office, no required meetings, no fixed hours. Contributors work from their home offices in different countries, coffee shops while traveling, co-working spaces, or wherever they're most productive. You collaborate through GitHub, communicate async, and work on your own schedule.

## Revenue Sharing

No traditional salaries here. Databayt is collectively owned by us - the contributors. When sales team brings in projects, we complete them together and everyone takes their share. You're not an employee; you're a co-owner building equity in something bigger.
We use a transparent revenue-sharing model where contributors earn a percentage of revenue generated from their contributions across our four core business models. [read more →](/docs/revenue)
