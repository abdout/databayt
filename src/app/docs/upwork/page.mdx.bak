### Current Progress

    (marketing)/

        proposal.ts              # Markdown proposal template builder
        prompt.ts                # Prompt strings shared with serverless endpoints
        repo.ts                  # Repository metadata used for relevance matching

    template/
      chatbot/                    # Generic, reusable chat experience powering many agents
        chat.tsx
        chat-message.tsx
        message-input.tsx
        typing-indicator.tsx
        use-scroll.ts
        ... (utilities, audio support, copy helpers)
```

**Flow Overview**
1. `UpworkBot` (client component) renders a `Chat` powered by the generic template/chatbot components.
2. When the user pastes a job description and hits **Send**:
   - `bot.tsx` calls the async `analyze()` helper which in turn delegates to either:
     • A local pure-TS implementation in `logic.ts` (default)  
     • Or a remote provider (OpenAI / Gemini) API route for richer LLM analysis.
3. `logic.ts` performs:
   - Keyword-based scoring (`scoreJob`).
   - Detail extraction (`extractJobDetails`).
   - Repository relevance matching (`findRelevantRepos`).
   - Proposal composition (`generateProposal`).
4. The formatted result is streamed back into the chat as the assistant message.
5. The user can iterate, copy, or tweak the generated proposal directly in the chat.

### Brainstorm
- **TypeScript vs. Rust vs. LangGraph**: Compare our current Node/TypeScript implementation against:
  • **Rust (e.g. using axum + Wasm/Edge)** – Pros: near-native speed, lower memory, strong type guarantees. Cons: longer compile times, smaller LLM ecosystem.  
  • **LangGraph / Python orchestration** – Pros: rich AI tooling, graph-based agent flows, mature community. Cons: additional runtime, bridging to Next.js.  
  → **Recommendation:** keep core web layer in TypeScript for tight Next.js integration, but spin out compute-heavy analysis (e.g. embedding similarity) into a small Rust service compiled to WebAssembly for edge execution.
- Migrate from `/api/*` routes to **Next.js Server Actions** wherever possible to simplify data-fetching and reduce client bundle size.
- Replace heuristic keyword scoring with an embedding-based similarity check (OpenAI embeddings or vector DB) for higher accuracy.
- Introduce streaming responses for LLM providers → real-time typing indicator already exists in template/chatbot.
- Add a **Job Board** panel listing fetched Upwork jobs with quick-apply shortcuts that pre-fill the chat with the job description.
- Persist chat sessions per job in localStorage / Supabase so context is preserved across reloads.
- Provide multiple proposal tones (casual, executive summary, technical deep-dive) via a dropdown.
- Integrate Resume / Portfolio snippets so the agent can reference concrete achievements automatically.
- Prompt-based refactor assistant ("shorten", "add timeline", "focus on ROI") to post-process generated proposals.

### Issues
1. **Modularize core logic**: Split `src/components/agent/upwork/logic.ts` into focused files:  
   • `scoring.ts` → `scoreJob` & weight constants  
   • `extract.ts` → `extractJobDetails`  
   • `repos.ts` → `findRelevantRepos` (plus future embedding helpers)  
   • `proposal.ts` → `generateProposal`  
   Keep a barrel export in `logic.ts` for backward-compatibility.
2. **Remove duplication**: Delete legacy `score.ts` and update all imports to the new modules.
3. **Finish model selector**: Implement `model.tsx` to choose provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Local) and parameters.
4. **Server actions pipeline**: Add typed `analyze` action (`actions.ts`) and deprecate any remaining API routes.
5. **State persistence**: Store chat sessions & provider choice with `usePersistentState` (localStorage/Supabase).
6. **Dynamic weighting UI**: Expose sliders/toggles for adjusting scoring weights in real time.
7. **Prompt library build-out**: Populate `prompt.ts` with reusable system/user prompts and role templates.
8. **Testing**: Add Vitest unit tests for all new modules and CI workflow.
9. **CI/CD**: GitHub Action for lint, test, and type-check on every PR.

### Prompt Library
```prompt
// Generate Upwork analyze server action
Create `src/components/agent/upwork/actions.ts` exporting an async `analyze` server action that:
1. Receives { description, repositories }.
2. Calls OpenAI chat completions with the system prompt from `src/components/agent/upwork/prompt.ts`.
3. Returns { score, details } JSON matching `JobAnalysis`.

// Consolidate duplicate scoring logic
Move all functions from score.ts into logic.ts, export unified helpers, delete score.ts and update imports project-wide.

// Persist chat history
Implement a usePersistentState hook in src/components/lib/use-persistent-state.ts that mirrors useState but syncs to localStorage keyed by window.location.pathname.

// Add embedding-based repo matching
Enhance findRelevantRepos in logic.ts to:
1. Generate embeddings for description & repo descriptions using @upstash/vector.
2. Compute cosine similarity and pick top-N repos where similarity > 0.75.

// Scaffold Vitest tests
Create tests/logic.test.ts with cases for scoreJob, extractJobDetails, generateProposal ensuring expected outputs for sample descriptions.
```
